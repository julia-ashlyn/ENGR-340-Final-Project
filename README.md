# ENGR-340-Final-Project
This project is Julia Larson's Final Project for ENGR 340 at JMU. This project focuses on comparing PERG-IOBA Datasets from patients with various diagnoses to determine if there is a difference between PERG signal results from subjects with various diagnosis conditions. 

**General Topic**

The conditions included in this program are (1) a diagnosis of "Normal" with no additional notes, (2) a diagnosis of "Retinitis Pigmentosa" with no additional notes or secondary diagnoses, and (3) a diagnosis of "Normal" with additional notes of "Mercury Poisoning". 
The purpose of this program is to use statistical analysis and graphical comparison of PERG signals at various conditions to determine if the pattern electroretinogram could aid in diagnosing retinitis pigmentosa. To do this, three questions of interest are posed: 
(1) Is there a difference in PERG signal trends and values between the right and left eye in individual "Normal No Notes" Condition? 
(2) Are PERG signal trends and values different between individuals with retinitis pigmentosa and normal diagnoses? 
(3) Is there a difference between PERG signals of subjects with normal and mercury poisoning diagnoses? 

**Depedencies and Additional Programs**

This program requires that the following packages be installed: 
scipy
numpy
matplotlib
textwrap

**Main Programs**

The main program of this repository is final_project.py. It is the only program required to run the program to analyze the data. Functions are defined within the main program. 

**Tutorial**

To operate this code, you must simply have all of the data downloaded and ensure the pathways remain the same as set up in the repository. Then, you run the main code, final_project.py. 
Once the code is run, the progression of the program is to follow the order of questions to be answered. 

Address general topic and challenge the code addresses
a list of any required dependencies and additional programs
the main programs written to analyze the data
a tutorial/walkthrough of how to operate the code
a sample of results from the analysis
any limitations on running the program
a brief discussion of future results
