# ENGR-340-Final-Project
This project is Julia Larson's Final Project for ENGR 340 at JMU. This project focuses on comparing PERG-IOBA Datasets from patients with various diagnoses to determine if there is a difference between PERG signal results from subjects with various diagnosis conditions. 

**General Topic**
The conditions included in this program are (1) a diagnosis of "Normal" with no additional notes, (2) a diagnosis of "Retinitis Pigmentosa" with no additional notes or secondary diagnoses, and (3) a diagnosis of "Normal" with additional notes of "Mercury Poisoning". 
The purpose of this program is to use statistical analysis and graphical comparison of PERG signals at various conditions to determine if the pattern electroretinogram could aid in diagnosing retinitis pigmentosa. 


Address general topic and challenge the code addresses
a list of any required dependencies and additional programs
the main programs written to analyze the data
a tutorial/walkthrough of how to operate the code
a sample of results from the analysis
any limitations on running the program
a brief discussion of future results
